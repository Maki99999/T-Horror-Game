# Halloween - Candy Hunt
A small horror game I made for halloween. 

You go from house to house avoiding children and other obstacles. For each house, you'll have to complete a minigame in which you have to press the buttons displayed.

Let me know if you found any bugs or if you have suggestions for improvements of any kind.
