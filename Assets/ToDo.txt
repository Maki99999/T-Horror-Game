intro: video, then a scream (or the other way around), 
  then you start at a house (not MCs) that is on the side 
  (maybe start from inside and walk to the exit on the right; maybe backside of the house so it can connect to the outro)
MC carries big bag with him (with simple physics for the bag and the rope connecting the bag and MC)
outro: opposite side of intro house, mc rings, woman answers, she doesn't have candy 
  -> MC trars off her head and puts it in the bag -> maybe loop to the intro
