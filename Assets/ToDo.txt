intro house: houseDoor, fenceDoor
MC carries big bag with him (with simple physics for the bag and the rope connecting the bag and MC)
endAnim

random bushes in gardens
more houses
more children
more door people
when a meter/bar is not shaking anymore -> center its position
random text in speech bubbles from door people: "you smell weird/funny"
amogus easter egg when you click on suspicion 99999 times
intro: video, then a scream (or the other way around), 
  then you start at a house (not MCs) that is on the side 
  (maybe start from inside and walk to the exit on the right; maybe backside of the house so it can connect to the outro)
outro: opposite side of intro house, mc rings, woman answers, she doesn't have candy 
  -> MC tears off her head and puts it in the bag -> maybe loop to the intro
